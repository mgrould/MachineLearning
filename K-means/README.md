## Abstract
Application of the [K-means clustering method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to the [Iris dataset of Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris). The aim of this project is to classify the flowers by species.

### Definition of the K-means method
The K-means method is used in unsupervised machine learning problems. K-means clustering aims to partition N observations into K clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. More precisely, the function to minimize is the squared Euclidian distance between the N observations and the mean of observations in each cluster. The initial K inital clusters are generated randomly, for instance if K=3, the 3 initial clusters are generated by randomly sepatating the dataset.

## Repository
